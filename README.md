# Transfer-learning
This repository is my storage of programs that i created while learning from ZTM(Zero to mastery course). 
Most of the code you can find on: https://www.learnpytorch.io/ but a lot of stuff was added and changed due to my stuburness not to use Jupyter notebook or Google colab

Most proud of from this I'm on utils.py  on function plot_most_wrong() witch took me quite a bit of time to crack. 
All functions has docstring that i believe is quite good. 

The data i used are availible on: https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/main/data witch is part of the course. 

Enjoy!
